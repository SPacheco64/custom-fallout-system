Every being in the world has certain basic attributes that describe what they are capable of. These 
attributes are Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck, or "SPECIAL" 
for short. 

- Strength: The raw might of a creature
- Perception: The acuity of a creature's senses (or sensors)
- Endurance: The hardiness of a creature and its survivability in environments
- Charisma: A creature's ability to obtain what it wants through interaction
- Intelligence: The intellectual capacity of a creature
- Agility: The reflex, motor-precision, and speed of a creature
- Luck: The general (mis)fortune of a creature

Each of a creature's SPECIAL attributes has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that 
attribute. A SPECIAL attribute is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a 
creature's training and competence in activities related to that ability.

A score of 4-6 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many others are a cut above (or below)
average in most attributes. Most beings cannot surpass a SPECIAL score higher than 10 in any attribute,
but their are certain creatures who balk at such limitations.

Each SPECIAL attribute also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -4 (for an ability 
score of 1) to +15 (for a score of 30). Most creatures will not exceed +5 (for a score of 10). These
modifiers are then added to every ability check made by that creature, in addition to any applicable 
skills. For example, Kayleigh has an Intelligence score of 8 (+3) and a Science score of 2 (+2). This 
means she adds a total of +5 to Intelligence (Science) checks. 

The easiest way to calculate a modifier for a SPECIAL score is determine the difference between it and
a score of 5.
-> 1 - 5 = -4
-> 8 - 5 = +3
-> 5 - 5 = +0

Certain abilities and effects can increase or decrease SPECIAL scores. Some temporarily, others 
permanently. Some examples are below:
- At 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th level you may increase one of your SPECIAL scores by 1.
- Your character drinks beer, a chem which increases your Strength score by 1 and decreases your 
  Perception score by 1. After an hour, these changes wear off.
- Your character fails their Death Saves, but your Overseer allows you to survive in exchange for a 
  permanent -2 decrease to your Luck score.

If any of a creature's SPECIAL scores become 0 for any reason or amount of time, they instantly die
except where explicitly stated otherwise or by decision of the Overseer.

At character creation, your character starts with a pool of 40 SPECIAL points you can allocate to each
attribute as you wish. However, the following should be observed:
- No score can exceed 10 or start lower than 1.
- No score should be set higher than 8 or lower than 3 without consulting your Overseer. For example,
  creating a Strength 9, Charisma 2 character may not be fun in a roleplay-heavy campaign.
- Don't spread your points thin so that all your scores land between 4-6. This is a cooperative game
  where a team should have diverse strengths and weaknesses. A group of Average Joe's will perform poorly
  and largely rely on the whim of random dice rolls.


So, what makes you SPECIAL*?
