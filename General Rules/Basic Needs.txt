Drinking

For every 24 hours you go without drinking two pints of water (40 oz. of water, or two dirty/purified waters) you gain
one level of exhaustion. Every 24-hour period you satisfy this requirement in, you reduce any exhaustion from lack of 
drinking by one, to a minimum of 0. Drinking cannot reduce exhaustion caused by other needs. 

Eating

For every 24 hours you go without eating two meals (roughly two food items) you gain one level of exhaustion. Certain
foods, such as Sugar Bombs, are considered snacks. Snacks provide their normal benefits (such as healing), but do not
contribute to satisfying your two meals a day. Every 24-hour period you satisfy this requirement in, you reduce any 
exhaustion from lack of eating by one, to a minimum of 0. Eating cannot reduce exhaustion caused by other needs. 

Sleeping

For every 24 hours you go without sleeping for 8 hours (typically as part of a long rest) you gain one level of 
exhaustion. Every 24-hour period you satisfy this requirement in, you reduce any exhaustion from a lack of sleeping by 
one, to a minimum of 0. Sleeping cannot reduce exhaustion caused by other needs.
