Special Items

Not even the apocalypse can stop the power of drip. But while wasteland fashion can already be...unique...some items go
beyond mere apparel. Almost more like talismans, they are an integral part of a wasteland legend. These are known as 
special items.

Your character has 3 slots available for special items, with each item occupying 1 slot. You can wear/use more special 
items than you have slots for, but you only gain the unusual properties of those special items for which you assigned a
slot. Additional constraints include:
- You cannot use multiple of the same kind (can't stack the benefits of TWO lucky rabbits' feet)
- You cannot use conflicting items (like wearing two hats)
- If wearing more than 3 special items, you much declare which ones are in slots and cannot change this allotment until
your next short rest.

Something else important to note is that not every instance of an item is special. I.e. not all aviator glasses are 
Authority glasses.
