Backpacks

"Backpack" collectively refers to the various bags, pouches, and actual backpacks wastelanders frequently use to help 
carry their goods, ammo, and junk. A Small or Medium creature can only equip one backpack at a time while Tiny, Large,
Huge, and Gargantuan creatures cannot equip backpacks at all, unless otherwise stated. In these cases, a Large creature
can equip 2 backpacks, a Huge creature 3 backpacks, and a Gargantuan creature 5 backpacks.

Backpacks increase a creature's carrying capacity by a number of pounds listed in the Property column. This increase is
also added to the creature's encumberance limit and heavy encumberance limit. For example, a Medium creature with 
Strength 7 would receive the following benefits if it equipped a travel bag:

Carrying Capacity: 70 lbs. -> 85 lbs.
Encumbered At: 49 lbs. -> 64 lbs.
Heavily Encumbered At: 63 lbs. -> 78 lbs.
