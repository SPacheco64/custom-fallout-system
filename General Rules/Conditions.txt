Conditions

*** Blinded ***
- A blinded creature can't see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
- Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's attack rolls have disadvantage.

*** Charmed ***
- A charmed creature can't attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities, attacks, or effects.
- The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.

*** Deafened ***
- A deafened creature can't hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.

*** Exhaustion ***
Some environmental hazards, such as starvation and the long-term effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can 
lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can 
give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect's description.

Level	Effect
1	Disadvantage on ability checks
2	Speed halved (round up)
3	Disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws
4	Hit point maximum halved
5	Speed reduced to 0
6	Death
If an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion 
increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.

A creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature 
suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.

An effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect's description, with all exhaustion 
effects ending if a creature's exhaustion level is reduced below 1.

*** Frenzied ***
A frenzied creature cannot tell friend from foe, and must spend at least half of its AP each turn to attack the 
creature nearest to it. If a creature is frightened at the time an effect causes it to be frenzied, the two conditions
cancel each other out and end immediately.

*** Frightened ***
- A frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line 
  of sight.
- The creature can't willingly move closer to the source of its fear.
- If a creature is frenzied at the time an effect causes it to be frightened, the two conditions cancel each other out 
  and end immediately.

*** Grappled ***
- A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed.
- The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).
- The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling 
  effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by a shove attack.

*** Incapacitated ***
- An incapacitated creature can't take actions, except to move.
