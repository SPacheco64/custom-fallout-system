Wielding power armor does not require a particular Strength score; rather, it increases your Strength and Endurance
each to a specific score indicated in the Str/End column. The cost column is the price of a full suit of armor pieces
for that kind of power armor - it does not include the price of the power armor frame, which is listed separately.

While worn, power armor increases the your size to Large. If powered by a fusion core charge, you are also not 
encumbered while wielding a Heavy weapon and can dual-wield weapons that don't have the Heavy keyword.
