At first level you start with a number of skill points determined by your character's race and 1 perk point, which can
be spent to unlock a new perk or to increase your rank in a perk you already have. Lastly, you also start with hit points
equal to 10 + your Endurance modifier (minimum of +0).

Every level gained thereafter, your player character receives a number of skill points equal to their Intelligence 
modifier (minimum of 1, maximum of 3) and gains another perk point. Additionally, they gain a number of hit points equal 
to their Endurance modifier (minimum of 1). At 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th level you may also increase one of your 
SPECIAL scores by 1. If a character increases their Endurance modifier at a later level, they retroactively gain any hit 
points they would've had if their Endurance modifier was always this high.
