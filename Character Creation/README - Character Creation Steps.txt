The following is the recommended order of steps to take when creating your character:

1. Determine your character's starting level and XP. Note both on your character sheet.

2. Pick your character's race. Note any special senses granted by it on your character sheet. List other racial traits
in the "Perks" section of your character sheet (if you wish).

3. Determine your character's background.

4. Determine your character's traits (gender, height, weight, etc.).

5. Name your character!

6. Determine your character's SPECIAL scores and note them along with their modifiers in your character sheet.

7. Determine your character's hit points and hit dice. Note on your character sheet any damage/condition resistances, 
immunities, or vulnerabilities determined by your race.

8. Determine your character's AP and natural AC (5 + Agility modifier).

9. Using the character's starting level, determine your starting skill points, perk points, and caps (in-game currency).

10. Allocate your skill points and note them in your character sheet.

11. Pick your perks and note them in your character sheet.

12. Determine your carrying capacity, encumberance and push/drag/lift.

13. Purchase (using your caps) whatever starting equipment you want to buy and add it your inventory.

14. If you purchased and wear armor, update your AC to reflect this.

15. Determine your movement speed (15 ft. by default)

16. Fill in the weapon quick-reference slots of your character sheet.

17. Phew! You should be good to go.
