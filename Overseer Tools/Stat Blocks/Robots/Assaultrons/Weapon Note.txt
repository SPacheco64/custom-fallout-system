Raider assaultron uses dual shishkebabs, but does NOT have a functioning beam laser.

Assaultron uses dual stealth blades. Plus a functioning beam laser.

Novatron uses a proton axe (or something similar, need to make it a new robot weapon) and a plasma rifle with the 
flamer mod. Plus a functioning beam laser.


BEAM LASER: Since it takes time to charge, maybe uses the laser musket rules?
