*** Robot ***

All robots have the following traits in common:

Machine. You do not need to eat or drink to survive and you are immune to disease. While you do not "sleep," once per 24
hours you must complete a long rest to perform repairs and systems diagnostics. Failure to do so gradually degrades your
performance and accumulates Exhaustion like normal. During the long rest you are semi-conscious of your surroundings (-5 
to passive Perception and disadvantage on Perception checks). Chems and medical supplies have no effect on you.

Semiconductors and Steel. You have immunity to poison, the poisoned condition, and radiation damage, as well as 
vulnerability to lightning damage. Every time you start your turn in waist-high water, every time you move through 10 
feet worth of waist-high water, and for every gallon of water dumped on you, you take 3 lightning damage (do not double 
this value to account for vulnerability).

Robot Weapons and Armor. Robots have access to unique weapons and armor exclusive to them. They can only be equipped
or unequipped at a workbench or with a long rest. "Human" weapons and armor are incompatible with their bodies.

Specialized. You have 2 skill points at first level.


*** Assaultron ***

Head Laser. Your head has a built-in laser beam weapon of devastating capability. It has the following properties:
- AP Cost: 3
- Damage: 6d10 energy
- Reload: 1 MF Cell or 1 Fusion Core charge per attack
- Range: 100 ft.
- Ammo: MF Cell or 1 Fusion Core charge
- Special (Spray): You can spend an additional 2 AP on an attack with this weapon, along with double the ammunition, to
  make one attack roll against every creature in a 15-foot radius of a point you can see. Creatures behind full-cover 
  in this radius are excluded from the attack.

Mobile. Your movement speed increases by 5 feet.

Superior Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if 
it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of green or red (your choice).


*** Gen-2 Synth ***

Almost Human. Your chassis is incompatible with robot armor; you use human armor instead. Likewise, your hands are 
incompatible with robot weapons; you use human weapons instead.

Limited Darkvision. You can see in dim light within 30 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it
were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.


*** Mr. Gutsy/Handy (Miss Gutsy/Nanny) ***

Inhuman. Your chassis and limbs are incompatible with human weapons and armor; you instead use robot weapons and armor.

Thruster. You ignore difficult terrain.

Thruster Arms. You have a trio of arms which you can apply special mods to in addition to your normal robot mods.


*** Protectron ***

Bulky. Your size is Large, doubling your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or lift. At the 
Overseer's discretion you may be too large to benefit from certain cover.

Natural Armor. Without armor, your character’s AC equals 8 + their Agility modifier (minimum 1).
