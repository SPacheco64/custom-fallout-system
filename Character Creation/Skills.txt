Each skill has three ranks, with each rank giving you an additional +1 bonus to ability checks made using that skill.
Skill ranks are purchased with skill points - 1 point per rank. To purchase skill ranks, at least one of your Special 
attributes related to that skill must have a score of 5 or greater.

Additionally, once a skill has reached all three ranks you can obtain "Expertise" in that skill. Expertise allows you
to gain up to three additional ranks in that skill, but at a higher cost: Each rank of expertise costs 3 skill points
instead of 1.

Each time you level up you gain a number of skill points based on your Intelligence score. For a score of 1-6 you gain
one skill point, from 7-8 you gain two, and from 9-10 you gain three. Raising your Intelligence modifier at a later level
does not retroactively award additional skill points from previous levels.

Rare skill book exist in the world to be found, bought, or claimed in battle. Once read, a skill book grants the reader 1
free skill point to use as they choose. A skill book can only provide this reward to a single creature before losing its 
beneficial properties.

Un-spent skill points can be saved for later or spent to purchase a party-wide XP reward. For every skill point spent 
this way, each adventurer in the party gains (10 * party level) XP.
